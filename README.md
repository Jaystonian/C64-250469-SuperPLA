# C64-250469-SuperPLA
Replacement board for a 251715-01 or 252535-01

I built one to test and topically it did not work, need to find time to understand why.  I suspect it was the AHCT chips, should use HCT.

Update 2023-04-07 The problem turns out to be the PCB's footprint for the SRAM, as Pin 1 is in the wrong location.
